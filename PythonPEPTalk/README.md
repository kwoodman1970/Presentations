# Python PEP Talk &ndash; Wisdom from the Python Steering Council

*Presented on  November 25, 2024*

The Python Steering Council manages changes to the Python programming language with a formal
system of [Python Enhancement Proposals](https://peps.python.org/), starting with [PEP
1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/) in June 2000.

Most PEP's are of little interest to the outside world but some can be applied to Python
programming in general and have been widely adopted by the Python development community as
near-canonical.  During this presentation, we went over the process of how the Python language
is changed and we looked at five PEP's that contain wisdom that every software developer
&ndash; whether they're familiar with Python or not &ndash; should be aware of.

The information in this presentation is appropriate for software developers of all experience
levels (and will be a good reminder for those with the most experience).
